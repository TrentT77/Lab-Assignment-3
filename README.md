# Lab-Assignment-3
Project for Web Development; you have to click on the exact words on the menu to go to another page and you have to copy the folder out of the zip folder for it to work properly. You probably already know that, but I didn't and spent an hour raging because it wouldn't work lol. All I had to do was move it to the desktop.
